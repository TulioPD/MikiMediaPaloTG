## Usage

This project is a a personal project so feel free to use, modify, and distribute as you wish. You can do with this code whatever you want, but take in mind there might be some files that I paid for and might be under some kind of commercial license. If you are going to use anything from this code I would recommend to change all the Resources in the Assets folder

## Contributing

This project is currently not accepting contributions as it is a personal project. However, feel free to fork the project and make any changes you'd like.


## Current features

This project contains a Card Selector, a pretty simple Card Database to easilly access test Cards, a Card UI builder/Editor and a few other WIP features.
I'm feeling pretty lazy to explain how the project is intended to work or be structured in the future, so read the code before doing any substantial changes and let's hope the universe helps you at understanding what am I even trying to do (don't blame me)

This project is a a personal project so feel free to use, modify, and distribute as you wish.

If you are going to use anything from this repo I would recommend to change all the Resources in the Assets folder

This project is currently not accepting contributions as it is a personal project. However, feel free to fork the project and make any changes you'd like.


## Current features

This project contains a Card Selector, a pretty simple Card Database to easilly access test Cards, a Card UI builder/Editor, a tool that lets you take a Screenshot of a Card displayed in the CardSelector class and a few other WIP features.

Assets/CardImage contains updated examples of a png generated using the canvas elements that represents a Card. It selects border, mana image and art image from a folder based on the card information. You can change the fonts and sprites used to anything you like without any major issues other than changinf a few sizes
